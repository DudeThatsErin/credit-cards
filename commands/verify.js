Well, you must be a spammer or someone who is incredibly lazy and *does not* want to read the pinned messages or scroll up in the <#823320169442967552> channel. Either way, we are not going to give you access because more than likely you are looking for a hand-out. Why don\'t you get off your ass and get a fucking job like the rest of the world instead of trying to look for a handout.\n\nPlease leave our discord server before our mod team bans you. Have a nice life moron!');
